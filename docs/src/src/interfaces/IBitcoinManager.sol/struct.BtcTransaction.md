[Git Source](https://github.com/temp-rsk/bitvmx-union-bridge-contracts/blob/bd6b4a28bf5973e554d9b7a237190a44cdd46b38/src/interfaces/IBitcoinManager.sol)

Represents a complete Bitcoin transaction structure for union bridge operations

*This struct follows Bitcoin's transaction format as defined in BIP-141 and related specifications*

*All multi-byte fields are stored in little-endian format (Bitcoin's native format)*

*The witness data is excluded from this struct as it's not needed for transaction id calculation*

*For more details on Bitcoin transaction structure, see: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/transaction/#structure-inputs-txid*
