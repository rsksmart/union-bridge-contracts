# BtcTxSPVProof
[Git Source](https://github.com/temp-rsk/bitvmx-union-bridge-contracts/blob/835a0374fad05fe95d66ed5d56f02d5826093237/src/interfaces/IPegCommonTypes.sol)

Represents a Bitcoin transaction with SPV proof for bridge validation

*Contains the transaction data along with merkle proof for block inclusion verification*

*Used to prove that a Bitcoin transaction is included in a specific block without full node verification*


```solidity
struct BtcTxSPVProof {
    bytes32 blockHash;
    BtcTransaction btcTx;
    uint256 merkleBranchPath;
    bytes32[] merkleBranchHashes;
}
```
